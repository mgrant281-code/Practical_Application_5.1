# Practical_Application_5.1
The goal of this project is to use visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.

This data is from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then ask the person whether he will accept the coupon if he is the driver. Answers that the user will drive there ‘right away’ or ‘later before the coupon expires’ are labeled as ‘Y = 1’ and answers ‘no, I do not want the coupon’ are labeled as ‘Y = 0’. There are five different types of coupons -- less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carry out & take away, bar, and more expensive restaurants ($20 - $50).

### The Target Audience for Bar Coupons
This analysis identified four key traits for drivers most likely to accept bar coupons:
<br>

**Frequent Visitors:** Drivers who visit bars more than once a month are significantly more likely to accept.

**Younger Demographic:** Drivers under 30 show higher acceptance, seeing coupons as a way to save on social outings.

**Adult Companions:** Those without children in the car are far more receptive to an offer for a bar stop.

**Budget-Minded:** Drivers with an income below $50,000 and those who frequently choose inexpensive restaurants are more likely to take the deal.

**The Takeaway:** The ideal bar coupon acceptor is a young, social, and budget-conscious individual already inclined to go out for leisure.
